# GPT Unicorn

GPT Unicorn is a project that explores the image generation capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 model by generating a new unicorn image every day. The project aims to track the changes and progress of the model over time by analyzing the generated images.

## Background

This project is inspired by the paper [Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf) by SÃ©bastien Bubeck, Varun Chandrasekaran, Ronen Eldan, Johannes Gehrke, Eric Horvitz, Ece Kamar, Peter Lee, Yin Tat Lee, Yuanzhi Li, Scott Lundberg, Harsha Nori, Hamid Palangi, Marco Tulio Ribeiro, and Yi Zhang. In the paper, the authors explore the capabilities of GPT-4, discussing its performance on tasks spanning various domains and tasks.

GPT Unicorn focuses on the image generation aspect of GPT-4, specifically its ability to create SVG images of unicorns. By generating a new image every day, we can assess the model's understanding of visual information and its ability to connect language and visual representation.

## How It Works

GPT Unicorn queries GPT-4 once per day to generate a new unicorn image in SVG format. The image generation process involves the following steps:

1. Query GPT-4 with the prompt "Draw a unicorn in SVG" etc (full prompt [in the source code](https://github.com/adamkdean/gpt-unicorn/blob/master/src/lib/generator.js#L40)).
2. Process the output to extract the SVG code.
3. Render the SVG code to produce the final image.
